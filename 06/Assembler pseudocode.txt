To create an assembler, we're going to need the following modules:

1:A parser that unpacks each instruction into its underlying fields.
2:Code that translates each field into its corresponding binary value.
3:A symbol table.
4:Main that initialises the I/O files and drives the process.

First develop a basic assembler that translates assembly programs without symbols.
Second develop the ability to handle symbols
Third, morph them together.
